        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>With more than 15,000 5-star reviews, this fan-favorite lasagna has to top the list. The consensus among reviewers: While this recipe does take over two hours to make, this lasagna tastes like it's from an Italian restaurant, even for first-time cooks. Calling it the world's best may be a little bold, but it certainly is Allrecipes' best lasagna.</p>
