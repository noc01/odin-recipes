        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Aji de gallina is a classic Peruvian dish, with shredded chicken wrapped in a smooth, creamy sauce with chili, cheese and walnuts. It's a delicious meal, plus perfect to adapt for leftovers.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ¾ cups cooked chicken approx (see note 1 to cook from scratch)</li>
            <li>2 slices bread or 3, if small, crusts removed</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk 80ml</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon walnuts</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon grated parmesan or a little more, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon aji amarillo chili paste or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken stock (or reserved poaching liquid)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Poach the chicken (if making from scratch - see details in note 1 below) then once cool enough to handle, shred it up. Alternatively, shred leftover cooked chicken</li>
            <li>CSoak the bread in the milk for a few minutes. Dice the onion in a small dice and finely dice the garlic</li>
            <li>Put the soaked bread, walnuts and parmesan in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth</li>
            <li>Warm the oil in a medium pan and add the onion. Cook a few minutes until softened then add the garlic, aji amarillo and turmeric and cook a minute more</li>
            <li>Add the bread-walnut mixture, the chicken and around ½ cup (120ml) of cooking water from the chicken or stock. You can add a little more or less to taste - it should be moist but not runny. Mix well and simmer for around 10 minutes before serving</li>
        </ol>
